## TagVisor.js — 10K code that Enhances a Web Page to become Couch-o-Matic mode ( time-based and other event-based animation with HTML5 effects ) 

[Check live demos here](http://taboca.github.com/TagVisor).

## Example of how the animation is described: 

Imagine a web page with html body and so on. You will need to add tagvisor.js, to put a chunk of markup as the following and make sure you have a div named 'slide1'. For the actual full source code see the ./tests directory.

    <ul id='animation'>
      <li data-target='slide1' data-time="2s" data-effect="scalefit" data-duration="3s" />
    </ul>
