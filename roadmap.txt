* enable hotlink from pages
* animation via URL 
* timer-based system and enable pause 

Use Case

1) Web Page wants to register animation for divs 1,2,3,4 and sets transition and timing using tags in the divs. It should exist the step step mode and the timed-step mode. When in timed-step the mode of operation iniates a timer and when reach points, events, are up, the events are triggered.  


* Steps are the Events
* Timed-Steps when timer events can trigger steps

Step Event spec: 

* A name
* A rule to dispatch to an element
* A time that event should occur 

When in timed-steps, an pre processor goes through all the steps and gathers the time information, or sequential ID, and adds them to an array / hash table.
